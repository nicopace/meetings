cft

- got tinySSB-demo confirmed at the IIW#39 (Internet Identity Workshop, Mountain View, Tue-Thu coming week), will be "speed demo" meaning 10 rounds of 5min each, back to back
- got LoRA-USB dongle working with a Python script, promising direct Laptop/Raspberry Pi coupling with LoRA instead of embedded devices
- from chat:
  > Today I gave a tinySSB talk at the "Emergency Comm Convention 2024" of the Swiss Radio Amateur Assoc, followed in the afternoon by a demo table where I had 8 Android devices to try it out.
  > The talk created quite some interest; later I had  both the main organizer of the event as well as the association's president at the table for discussions, they all want to know how this works. Two regional amateur sections will probably follow up with invites and may include tinySSB for their next emergency comm exercise with local municipalities and civil protection services.

nanomonkey
