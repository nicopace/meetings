## Updates

- Nico proposed a grant
- CFT experimented with a SQL database
    - test the size 
        - how is it for curator dealing with 500 attendees
    - goal is to surface management complexity
- IA is down
    - can't reach wendy
    - mix: I have wendy + mai on Signal
    - michael: [email reported back online](https://x.com/internetarchive/status/1845347779104604641)
- Michael can't make in person meeting in October


## Nico Grant

- 4 days to go
- have taken mix+cft feeback, going to integrate
- spent some time understanding Gitcoin Grants
    - structured around crypto + evidence
- not clear how details proposal should be

- any questions
    - mix: there is a scuttlebutt resourcing for grant writing
        - https://opencollective.com/scuttlebutt-grantwriting
    - cft: who is writing / working on this?
        - Luandro is really busy, but is into this
        - Luandro + Nico working on Meshtastic prototype
        - I'm happy to take help writing 

- this is basically a crowd-funding campaign
    - gitcoin does match-funding
        - quadratic funding - more people who contribute, the more resources we get
    - we will need pledges like $1-2 to support us
    - easy for those on Ethereum already

## SQL UI

Problem: CFT has made populated a SQL-lite database, and would like a small graphical interface where you can mutate the state. The purpose is to sit at a person with Internat Archive to work through the data and discuss what's useful / needed.


Michael:
    - Could be an "Admin user interface"?
    - Could you do this with just a piece of paper?
Mix:
    - could you do this with a walk-through of Sched?
CFT:
    - would be good to have the vocabullary of IA
Michael:
    - you could drop the Schema => ChatGPT etc and ask for a simple user interface

Nico:
    - Django can give you an admin interfact for a SQLite db
