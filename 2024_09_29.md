## Suggestions for a "Git Repo- and Directory Structure for TinySched" (cft 2024-09-29)

```TinySched``` is a placeholder, replace with what we will converge on
(S4 = Secure Scuttlebutt Scheduling System etc)


### Approach

- go for a minimum of repos i.e., two
- separate release-worthy code from development that includes UI and experiments with traditional DBs etc

### Repo 1 (SW for Android and ESP32)

Reuse https://github.com/ssbc/tinySSB

### Repo 2: "sandbox" (prepare and try out)

Suggestion1 = https://github.com/ssbc/S4-sandbox

Suggestion2 = https://github.com/S4-sandbox


Repo/directory structure for the sandbox
```

```

    
    
### Option B - new org
    
- github.com/tiny-ssb/prod
- github.com/tiny-ssb/notes
- github.com/tiny-ssb/design
    
#### Name of the Org:
    daitom
    tiny-butt
    EventYawl  (nautical theme)
    SchedSweeper (analogous to Minesweeper)

## Relational Database schema

follow up reflection from CFT:
- should we start with a relational schema
    - can we decouple append-only log + relational db?
    - aim could be to get towards a demo + discussable
